## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Linting ##

Run `npm run prettier:check` to see if any files are in violation of formatting rules, then run `npm run prettier:clean` to auto-lint.

## Amplify Commands ##

- `amplify status` will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
- `amplify add <category>` will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
- `amplify push` will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
- `amplify console` to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
- `amplify publish` will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
